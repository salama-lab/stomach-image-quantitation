stomach-image-quantitation contains 4 MATLAB scripts used to analyze microscopy data generated by Valerie O'Brien and coworkers in preparation to submit the following manuscript as of April 21, 2020:

"Helicobacter pylori alters metaplasia and accelerates dysplasia in a mouse model of gastric cancer preneoplastic progression."

Authors: Valerie P. Oâ€™Brien, Amanda Koehne, Julien Dubrulle, Armando E. Rodriguez, Christina K. Leverich, Paul Kong, Jean S. Campbell, Robert H. Pierce, Eunyoung Choi, James R. Goldenring and Nina R. Salama

The image data has been acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope and has been saved as .czi files. They contain 4 channels at 16-bit depth resolution in one z-stack. 
The following scripts invoke the MATLAB bioformat readers package (bfmatlab) that can be downloaded at:
https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.4/

* *StomachCytoK.m* quantifies the GSII and Ki67 markers when cytokeratin signal is present 
* *StomachCytoKnoK.m* quantifies the GSII and Ki67 markers when the cytokeratin signal is too dim or absent 
* *StomachbCol.m* quantifies the Trop2 signal in individual glands 
* *StomachGSIICD.m* quantifies the overlap between GSII and CD44v signals 

The *sampleImages* folder contains 4 image files in .czi format and one matlab .mat file that can be used as inputs for the scripts.
