The image data has been acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope and has been saved as .czi files. They contain 4 channels at 16-bit depth resolution in one z-stack. 
The following scripts invoke the MATLAB bioformat readers package (bfmatlab) that can be downloaded at:
https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.4/

* *StomachCytoK.m* quantifies the GSII and Ki67 markers when cytokeratin signal is present 
* *StomachCytoKnoK.m* quantifies the GSII and Ki67 markers when the cytokeratin signal is too dim or absent 
* *StomachbCol.m* quantifies the Trop2 signal in individual glands 
* *StomachGSIICD.m* quantifies the overlap between GSII and CD44v signals 
* *minminT.m* is an auxilliary function used to substract background

The *sampleImages* folder contains 4 image files in .czi format and one matlab .mat file that can be used as inputs for the scripts.
